# Interfacing R from a Python Notebook

This notebook teaches how to call R code from a Jupyter notebook set up with a Python 3 kernel.

Python and R are two programming languages integral to data science. While many prefer one or the other, it's best to have both in your toolkit in order to use each for its strengths. Switching languages in the middle of a project can be annoying if you have to export the data and switch environments every time - interfacing R from a Python notebook can help you out and allow you to use both languages in the same environment.
