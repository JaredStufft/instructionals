# Intro to Neural Networks in Python with Keras

This set of materials goes over a **very** basic intro to machine learning, an overview of the math fundamentals for neural networks,  
and how to apply and create neural networks in Python using the Keras package.

# Contents
* **NN w Keras.pptx:** Powerpoint presentation introducing the idea of machine learning and statistical modeling  
as well as the basic math behind neural networks.
* **Intro to Neural Networks in Python with Keras.ipynb:** A jupyter notebook containing the code examples and demonstration.
* **environment.yml:** `environment.yml` file produced by conda. This can be used to reproduce the environment used for the code examples.
* **requirements.txt:** `requirements.txt` file produced by `pip`. This can be used to install packages used in the code examples.
* **LoanStats.csv:** A CSV file containing the data used in the notebook.
