    "# Linear Regression Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression is one of the most basic and fundamental statistical models one can utilize - yet, its simplicity has allowed the model to become the basis for so many other methods. The idea is simple, given a set of independent variables and a continuous dependent variable, find the line that fits the best through the points. The equation for this line takes the format **Y = Œ≤0 + Œ≤1ùöæ1+ Œ≤2ùöæ2+ Œ≤2ùöæ2 + ‚Ä¶ + Œ≤nùöæn**, where Y is the continuous dependent variable, Œ≤0 is the intercept, ùöæn is the _nth_ independent variable, and Œ≤n is the coefficient for that independent variable. For a simple example of one independent variable and one dependent variable, a linear regression line may look something like this:\n",

    "The _error_ for an observation is the difference between the observed value and the predicted value - if you square this number and then sum them up, you get the _sum of squared errors (SSE)_, which is the number that a linear regression model will minimize to create the 'best fit'."

    "We've collected a data set containing information about houses in the Greater Boston area. Each row in our data set represents a census tract with aggregate characteristics about the area and the houses within, such as the average number of rooms per house and crime rate. We also have the median house value for the census tract. Using this data, we can analyze the factors that affect house prices and predict the median price of a house that may come on the market in that area. We'll walk through some basic steps to explore the data as well."
