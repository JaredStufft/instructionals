# Intro to Statistical and Machine Learning Modeling with Python

This notebook is designed to give a cursory look at statistical and machine learning modeling with Python.
It's not meant to make anyone an expert data scientist or statistician, nor will you come out of this

statistician might do and how it might be achieved with Python.
